Subject: [PATCH] ARM: Don't mention the full path of the source directory in
 mach-types.h
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

To make package building reproducible independent of the location of the
source tree, the absolute path of this source tree must not be mentioned
in the built artifact. So strip $abs_srctree from FILENAME in the
output.

This fixes a warning issued by Yocto:
	WARNING: linux-lxatac-6.7-r0 do_package_qa: QA Issue: File /usr/src/debug/linux-lxatac/6.7-r0/arch/arm/include/generated/asm/mach-types.h in package linux-lxatac-src contains reference to TMPDIR
